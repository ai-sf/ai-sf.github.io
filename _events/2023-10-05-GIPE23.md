The Italian Association of Physics Students (AISF), in the current year 2023, organizes on early October the German Italian Physics Exchange (GIPE), an international event of a scientific-cultural nature.

### Chi

Applications are open to all Physics students, starting from those enrolled in the first year of the Bachelorâ€™s degree up to PhD students, coming from various universities affiliated with AISF and IAPS. Among these, 40 participants will be selected at most: the goal is to have the highest number of universities represented, trying to obtain a group of participants equally divided between Italians and Germans.

### Dove

After a forced break caused by COVID, the University of Bari Aldo Moro, and more specifically the Interuniversity Department of Physics Michelangelo Merlin, have been chosen to host the event.
